# Crozier_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Michael Crozier final project for Data Structures

PROJECT SUMMARY:
A linked list simulating an Oregon Trail like game where the user picks different routes with different weights in an attempt to get to the final location. Weights to consider when choosing paths will be time, food and water usage, and some kind of fuel. Also put into consideration are how many stops will be taken, where events like sicknesses and attacks can happen at stops, but also rest. Won't actually be in the Oregon Trail, some other kind of setting, not sure what yet.

HOW TO RUN:
Clone the repository and run it with any c++ compiler. I used codeblocks, but I don't think that should matter. Download the main, and Trail.cpp and .h files, should work from there when you compile the main.

DEPENDENCIES:
Only uses the basic c++ libraries.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
I made it in Linux in C++, so I don't think there are any requirements.

GROUP MEMBERS:
